# Chap 1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
## From rules to data
> In these videos, you were given an introduction to the concepts and paradigms of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. You saw that the traditional paradigm of expressing rules in a coding language may not always work to solve a problem. As such, applications such as computer vision are very difficult to solve with rules-based programming. Instead, if we feed a computer with enough data that we describe (or label) as what we want it to recognize -- given that computers are really good at processing data and matching patterns -- then we could potentially ‘train’ a system to solve a problem. We saw a super simple example of that: fitting numbers to a line. So now, let’s go through a notebook and execute the code that trains a neural network to learn how a set of numbers make up a line. After that, you will feed the trained network a new data point and see if it correctly predicts the expected value.
